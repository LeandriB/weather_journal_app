# Weather Journal App

## About

The goal for this project is to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. This will require modifying the ```server.js``` file and the ```website/app.js``` file. You can see ```index.html``` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use ```style.css``` to style your application to customized perfection.

## How to run this program

Make sure all your dependencies are installed in your terminal or updated to the lasest version, ```cd``` into the project folder and start up the server in the terminal using ```node server.js``` and open the web page through a localhost in your browser.
